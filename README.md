Solving Leetcode problems for practice

**ContainDupliacte**
For this Problem we initiate unordered set and try to iterate through nums which is vector which contains all elements and first before adding we try to check if thats element present in the set if not then  we add them if yes then we return True

**TwoSum**
For this Problem we initiate unorderded map iterate over target-nums[i] here goal is to return the index of nums[i]+nums[j]=target so we check if target-nums[i] present in map then return and append in vector if not then insert the element here we use unordermap save as key as nums[i] and iterator point to save array location as i so S[nums[i]]=i
